    <p>Get card moved to list retrieves any card moved to a "set" list since it was last called. </br>This will output a payload for every
    moved card eg 5 cards moved to set list 5 msg.payload</p>

          <dt>payload <span class="property-type">Json</span></dt>

          any card moved after this timestamp will be outputted on the initial run.</br>
          <b>Note</b>: if for any reason the node loses its context variable, the next run will reuse this variable as a
           start time potentially causing unwanted duplication. Every deployment will clear the context variables.</dd>
