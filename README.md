# node-red-contrib-trello-functions

This is my first node project, the idea is to have very easy 
and simple to use node functions that capture meaningful Trello events.

As this is my first project I am a little unsure where to take this, 
so I am very open to any suggestions or help and it will be greatly appreciated.






### Current plans to implement
* A function node to detect a card moving between lists.
* Also taking suggestions on other nodes.
