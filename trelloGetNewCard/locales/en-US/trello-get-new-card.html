    <p>Get new Trello card retrieves any card created since it was last called. </br>This will output a payload for every
    new card eg 5 new cards 5 msg.payload</p>

      <h3>Output</h3>
      <dl class="message-properties">
          <dt>payload <span class="property-type">Json</span></dt>

        <dd>A optional time stamp parsable by "new Date()",
          any card made after this timestamp will be outputed on the initial run.</br>
          <b>Note</b>: if for any reason the node loses its context variable, the next run will reuse this variable as a
           start time potentially causing unwanted duplication. Every deployment will clear the context variables.</dd>
