    <p>Get Trello card moved lists retrieves any card that has moved lists since it was last called. </br>This will ouput a payload for every
    card moved eg 5 moved cards 5 msg.payload</p>

      <h3>Output</h3>
      <dl class="message-properties">
          <dt>payload <span class="property-type">Json</span></dt>
          <dd>A single <a href="https://developers.trello.com/v1.0/reference#card-object">Trello card object</a></dd>
      </dl>
      <h3>Input</h3>
      <dl class="message-properties">
        <dt>payload.initialTimeStamp <span class="property-type">number</span></dt>
        <dd>A optional time stamp parsible by "new Date()",
          any card moved after this timestamp will be ouputed on the initial run.</br>
          <b>Note</b>: if for any reason the node loses its context variable, the next run will reuse this variable as a start time potentially causing unwanted duplication.
          This will generate a warning log when the node uses this input. Every deployment will clear the context variables. </dd>
      </dl>
